# Producer_Consumer_Semaphore

Inputs to code:
● Enter the buffer size: <Integer>
● Enter the number of consumers: <Integer>
● Enter the maximum integers to produce: <Integer>

Output:
For buffer size 5, 3 consumers, 1 producer and maximum integer to produce to be 20, output
will look like below (Since it is a multithreading application, your machine might show different
sequence for consumers but ultimate goal is everything from the buffer is read by consumers
and they terminate gracefully).
